Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) present an exciting alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Both KANs and MLPs have strong mathematical roots, but they diverge in their underlying principles. MLPs rely on the universal approximation theorem, while KANs are grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem.
