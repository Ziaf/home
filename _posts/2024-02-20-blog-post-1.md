Let’s consider an example of a deep learning model used for multi-class classification, such as a model that predicts the type of flower in an image. Suppose we have a dataset of 1000 images of flowers, each labeled with one of three possible classes: rose, daisy, or sunflower. We train a deep learning model to classify these images into one of these three classes.

After training, we evaluate the model’s performance on a separate test set of 200 images. The model outputs a probability score for each class, indicating the likelihood that the image belongs to that class. For example, the model might output a score of 0.8 for the rose class, 0.1 for the daisy class, and 0.1 for the sunflower class for a particular image.

However, these probability scores may not accurately reflect the actual likelihood of each class.
