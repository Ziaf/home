[What is the Beggar’s Method in permutation and combinations? The Beggar’s Method, also known as the Stars and Bars Theorem, is a combinatorial method used to determine the number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable objects (stars) into  k distinguishable bins (bars). This method is particularly useful in solving problems related to combinations and partitioning of integers.](https://medium.com/@faizanansari541/what-is-the-beggars-method-in-permutation-and-combinations-f83e9af80689)
